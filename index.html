<!--Include a homepage and at least one other page, for your best-selling T-shirt (you can download a T-shirt image from ThinkGeek)
A language is specified for the website (it does not have to be in English!)
A title and meta name="description" are provided for each page
Every page includes a link to a favicon.ico file with the company logo (you can create one here or design one yourself)
Location information is provided on every page (you can place the store anywhere in the world, as long as there's an existing building there)
When each page is shared on Facebook and Twitter, a beautiful card is generated (and the respective validators should return no errors/warnings â€” though you can ignore the Share App ID Missing warning for Facebook)
